<p class='body_text'> The Glossary in GeneBank22 provides a brief definition of frequently used terms in the website.

<!-- Static table defining frequently used terms in the website-->
<table border='1'>
<tr><th>Terms</th><th>Definitions</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>Accession number</tt></td>
<td>GenBank sequence identifiers consist of an accession number of the record followed by a dot and a version number (i.e. 	 accession. version). The version number is incremented whenever the sequence record is updated.It is a unique identifier for a sequence record.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>Amino acid</tt></td>
<td>Amino acids are organic compounds that contain amine (-NH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups, along with a side chain 	(R group) specific to each amino acid. Amino acid translations correspond to a nucleotide coding sequence.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>Gene</tt></td>
<td>Genomic locus where transcription occurs. A gene may have one or more transcripts, which may or may not encode proteins.<td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>Exon</tt></td>
<td>Transcribed genomic region that remains in the RNA after splicing, includes both the CDS and the UTRs.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>Intron</tt></td>
<td>Transcribed genomic regions that is removed from the RNA by splicing.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>Coding region</tt></td>
<td>The coding region of a gene, also known as the CDS (from coding sequence), is the portion of a gene's DNA or RNA that codes 	for protein.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>Gene ID</tt></td>
<td>Entrez Gene generates unique integers (GeneID) as stable identifiers for genes and other loci for a subset of model 	   organisms. It tracks those identifiers and uses them to integrate multiple types of information including nomenclature, 	  summary descriptions, accessions of gene-specific and gene product-specific sequences, chromosomal localization, reports of   pathways and protein interactions, associated markers and phenotypes.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>Codon usage frequency</tt></td>
<td>The frequency of codons, also known as codon usage bias, can vary from species to species with functional implications for the control of translation.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>Restriction enzyme</tt></td>
<td>Restriction enzymes cleave DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within DNA at locations known as 	restriction sites.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>5'UTR</tt></td>
<td>The region of a coding cDNA upstream of the start codon which is not translated.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>3'UTR</tt></td>
<td>The region of a coding cDNA downstream of the stop codon which is not translated.</td>
</tr>
