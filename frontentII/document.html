<h3 class='subheads'>About ChromAwesome22</h3>
<p> The ChromAwesome22 browser interacts with a dedicated genetic sequence database of Human Chromosome 22. It was set-up as part of a group Masters project by students from Birkbeck College, University of London. The sequence data is based on build GRCh38 data from <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/'>GenBank</a>.

<h3 class='subheads'>Searching chromosome 22 for genes</h3>
<p> The first search option returns data about the selected gene on human chromosome 22. The data displayed are: Accession number, Gene Id, Protein product name, Chromosomal location, DNA sequence with exon locations, coding sequence mapped to their respective amino acid sequence, codon usage table frequency within the gene as well as across chromosome 22.

<h3 class='subheads'>Search for restriction enzyme sites</h3>
<p> A search for restriction enzyme sites on the sequence of interest is enabled by enterin Accession number and Restriction Enzyme type for a particular gene.
